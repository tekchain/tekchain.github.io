                        Could your organisation afford to lose revenue, customers or hard-won reputation? Unfortunately,
                        these can be the consequences of a successful cyberattack – and such attacks are increasingly
                        common.

                                As well as assisting on specific security issues, we offer strategic guidance on the
                                management of security and risk. Our services are designed to help organisations looking
                                to take a long-term view, and ensure you have the correct procedures and controls in
                                place to successfully protect your business.

                                An important aspect of our strategic advice is to optimise the return of your investment
                                in security measures, ensuring your money is being spent wisely. We can review your
                                setup to identify cost-saving opportunities (for example, cyber liability insurance
                                premiums may be reduced by addressing underwriters' concerns with specific "point
                                solutions").

                                To help you define your security strategy, we start by analysing the status quo.
                                Identifying and classifying the critical assets that make up your business (eg. systems,
                                data, trade secrets and so on), and working with you to determine your organisation’s
                                attitude to risk, we develop a clear, actionable roadmap to get you where you need to
                                be. This roadmap covers everything from quick wins to more gradual, longer-term changes,
                                and it’s fully customised to your risk appetite, budget and timeframe.

                                In today’s world, successfully operating your business demands that you ensure the
                                confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of your data. The use of strong cryptography
                                supported by a solid key management foundation allows you to protect your sensitive
                                information, which is more important than ever; infringements of data legislation such
                                as GDPR can incur huge fines.

                                To ensure the security of data belonging to you and your customers, we offer a full

                                your cryptography and the processes around key management really are. We’ll uncover any
                                weaknesses in your systems before helping you to adopt a modern approach to cryptography
                                and key management. The result? A cost-effective route to achieve the crypto agility you
                                need to face down advances in the field of cryptanalysis.

                            <p>With the cloud touching every element of modern digital operations it’s crucial to ensure
                                the security model is well understood. Cloud security rests on a shared responsibility
                                model, which calls for clarity between the cloud provider and customer, to define who is
                                responsible for securing what.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It’s also important to select the right cloud deployment and service models for your own
                                circumstances. These can vary based on your unique needs, anticipated workload and
                                security requirements, but a sound security architecture will be required whatever the
                                setup.

                                every element of your cloud deployment – including those involving cloud migration,
                                multi-cloud architecture and big data.

                                Organisations that successfully handle cybersecurity realise a cultural shift is as
                                necessary as any technological one. Embracing this and approaching security as a shared
                                responsibility is the way to develop a long-standing resilience to evolving threats.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Hence the rise of DevSecOps – a delivery mindset that rolls development, security and
                                operations into a single holistic approach. DevSecOps avoids the problems that commonly
                                arise from more siloed functions, where security considerations can either fall between
                                the gaps or become involved too late in delivery.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                As your DevSecOps capability matures, it will become a competitive advantage. Having the
                                correct skills, procedures and security tooling working together throughout the pipeline
                                allows you to put high quality software in the hands of your customer far more quickly.

                                At Tekchain we’re experienced in delivering critical systems using a DevSecOps approach.
