                        The pace of change within the tech sector means that skill sets require regular appraisal and proactive development if they are to stay current. The importance of this is hard to overstate; if self-development is neglected, skills can become obsolete faster than might be anticipated.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Conversely, the right blend of skill sets within a team can have a transformative effect. At Tekchain we place a high emphasis on developing our own technical skills and approaches, and we’ve created a range of services to pass them on to our clients.

                                The role of Chief Information Security Officer has an increasingly high profile, and with good reason; the frequency, variety and sophistication of security threats is growing all the time. The complex nature of these threats means it can be difficult for time-poor leaders to stay close to the necessary detail.

Whether you use our service as a way to air ideas or to solicit an unbiased second opinion, we can make the decision-making process easier and help you perform at your best.

                                Decisions regarding the technology and providers you work with can have far-reaching implications, both in terms of cost and outcome. As such it can pay to have a second opinion on vital choices. We can produce neutral, fact-based vendor evaluation reports that will help you feel sure the procurement decisions you make are the right ones.

                                As well as assisting on specific security issues, we offer strategic guidance on the
                                management of security and risk. Our services are designed to help organisations looking
                                to take a long-term view, and ensure you have the correct procedures and controls in
                                place to successfully protect your business.

                                An important aspect of our strategic advice is to optimise the return of your investment
                                in security measures, ensuring your money is being spent wisely. We can review your
                                setup to identify cost-saving opportunities (for example, cyber liability insurance
                                premiums may be reduced by addressing underwriters' concerns with specific "point
                                solutions").
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                To help you define your security strategy, we start by analysing the status quo.
                                Identifying and classifying the critical assets that make up your business (eg. systems,
                                data, trade secrets and so on), and working with you to determine your organisation’s
                                attitude to risk, we develop a clear, actionable roadmap to get you where you need to
                                be. This roadmap covers everything from quick wins to more gradual, longer-term changes,
                                and it’s fully customised to your risk appetite, budget and timeframe.

                                Organisations that successfully handle upskilling realise a cultural shift is as
                                necessary as any technological one. Embracing this and approaching security as a shared
                                responsibility is the way to develop a long-standing resilience to evolving threats.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Hence the rise of DevSecOps – a delivery mindset that rolls development, security and
                                operations into a single holistic approach. DevSecOps avoids the problems that commonly
                                arise from more siloed functions, where security considerations can either fall between
                                the gaps or become involved too late in delivery.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                As your DevSecOps capability matures, it will become a competitive advantage. Having the
                                correct skills, procedures and security tooling working together throughout the pipeline
                                allows you to put high quality software in the hands of your customer far more quickly.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                At Tekchain we’re experienced in delivering critical systems using a DevSecOps approach.
                                As such we’re well-placed to advise you on how to embed the tailored mix of technologies
                                and best practices that are involved.
